# pandas_practice_py_2021_04

- Personal side project to create excel pivot automation for work.

- Goal is to make pivot table for 3 individual raw data excel and combine the three into one

**Development Note**

_20210421_

- Since the pivot I did at work doesn't require only column and values, having trouble.
- For now, trying to use filter column option to proceed.
- Finished filtering and adding origin to Korea.
- Will try doing both China and Indonesia tomorrow.
- Current changed plan is to filter & add origin to all three files, combine them giving new row of titles.

_20210422_

- added indonesia.py & china.py the filters respective xlsx files.
- implemented column rename to each country function. (need to look how to do this in single go)
- added order_status variable which combines all three filters & renamed DFs.
- tomorrow : change multiple values in Customer and Pattern Column.
